# React Native QR Code Generation and Scanning App

## Project Summary

Mobile App for iOS and Android that allows business users to generate unique QR codes for clients and enables convenient scanning. 
By integrating with Google APIs (OAuth and Sheets), when scanning a client's QR code, the app automatically updates a Google Sheets cell to confirm client attendance to an appointment. 
Built using React Native and Expo.

## Problem Statement
An NGO came to us with a problem. They needed a better **way to track attendance** to their different kind of appointments and classes. 
This data was used to **report to their donors** and to **keep track of the number of people they were helping**.
It also helped them to **identify who attended the classes/appointments and who did not** which was important so that they could finish the program plan they had for each person.
They were using a **paper to track attendance during the day** and log in to their CMS in the night to enter the collected data, 
the reason for this was that their **current CMS platform was really old and not user friendly with poor UX and UI**, often needing to go through multiple pages to enter the data for each student.
This was a **manual process** that was not only **time consuming** taking away from their productivity to help more people but it was also **prone to human error**.
They came to us looking for a way to **automate the process of tracking attendance** and logging it into their CMS.

## Project Solution
We built a mobile app for iOS and Android integrated with Google APIs (OAuth and Sheets) that allows business users to generate unique QR codes for clients and enables convenient scanning.
This mobile app was built using React Native and Expo. The Google Sheets rows got filled with data from the CMS in real time with the use of Zapier and the app was able to read the data from the QR code 
and update the Google Sheets row with the attendance data once the QR code was scanned. This allowed the NGO to **track attendance in real time** and **automate the process of logging the data into their CMS**.
In addition to this, the app also allowed the NGO to **track the number of people they were helping** and **identify who attended the classes/appointments and who did not** 
with the use of Looker Studio dashboards that were connected to the Google Sheets data in real time which enabled them to have rich data visualizations and reports which in turn could help them report to their donors.
