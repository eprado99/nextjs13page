# NextJS 13 Portfolio Page


## Project Summary
This is a portfolio page built using NextJS 13.4. 
The main purpose for building this page was to have a portfolio page to 
showcase my projects since often than not, 
I find my resume to be limited in information by omitting important details in order to keep it short, 
lacking visual representation of project and due to the nature of these resumes being standarized it ends 
up lacking my own personal touch. This page is developed keeping in mind intuitivity and simplicity 
while keeping in mind SEO and accessibility best practices. The page is fully responsive and uses TailwindCSS for styling.
As for the projects, they are fetched from a MDX file and rendered dynamically using NextJS's Static Site Generation (SSG).
The page is deployed on Vercel.
