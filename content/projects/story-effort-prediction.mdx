# Story Effort Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Summary
A company currently uses the Scrum framework to manage its software development process. 
This involves the use of user stories to describe the features of the software to be developed. 
Each user story is assigned an effort value that represents the amount of work required to implement the story. 
The effort value is determined by the development team during the sprint planning meeting which can be extremely time consuming.
<br />
With the use of datasets containing user stories and their corresponding effort values, we trained a machine learning model that can predict the effort of a story based on the story's titles, description & previous estimates.
Additional to this, we created a web application that allows users to input a story's title and description and get a prediction of the effort required to implement the story, it also supports bulk uploading stories in .csv format getting a list of predictions back.
Lastly, this web application allows users to see other user stories entered before and their predictions, this allows the team to have an idea previous to a meeting about a story.
<br />
This brings the following benefits:
- It is fast
- It does not require the presence of all team members.

## Problem Statement
While there is a variety of user story estimation techniques such as the Planning Poker method where Fibonacci sequence numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc.) 
are used to estimate the effort of a story where typically the Scrum Master describes the user story and team members choose a number and 
the number that gets the most votes is the final estimation, the problem with this method is that it is time-consuming and requires the presence of all team members.
<br />
With the arise of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing models getting better and better, 
it is possible to train a model that can predict the effort of a story based on the story's description.
Which is a perfect solution to this problem as it is fast and does not require the presence of all team members.
Instead team members can use the model to predict the effort of a story and then discuss the prediction and agree on a final estimation.
